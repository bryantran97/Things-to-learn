# Things-to-learn

UPDATE: After I finish some of my self-study material and projects I'll be turning this repository into a ROADMAP to my GITHUB. So users can have an easier time browsing my page. Getting rid of this content because it's kind of pointless to point out.

This repository will be a personal guide and roadmap to the things I've been wanting to learn and as well as things I need to learn to earn a job as a developer. Currently, my dream is to become a Full-Stack developer. Initially what started off as a curiousity turned into an obsession of mine. I thought I would never make websites, but in the end, all I want to do is make websites. Here is are some of my short-term goals in terms of projects and things I need to learn.
